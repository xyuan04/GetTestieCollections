# GetTestieCollections
write some tests that exercise the Collections classes


create a project where you write 1 or 2 tests for each every one of these Collections classes. Figure out what the most common, most useful methods are, and use them in the test you write for the class.
The class should be, say, TestHashMap, and then have a TestHasMap methid which uses the various methods you deem useful.

I've included two classes, `Person` and `Address` should you need a concrete class to supply to a generic structure. Feel free to use `Integer` and/or `String` as well.

### Make tests for each of these:

- For the Set interface, __HashSet__ is the most commonly used implementation.
- For the List interface, __ArrayList__ is the most commonly used implementation.
- For the Map interface, __HashMap__ is the most commonly used implementation.
- For the Queue interface, __LinkedList__ is the most commonly used implementation.
- For the Deque interface, __ArrayDeque__ is the most commonly used implementation.

Also include a test for __Vector,TreeMap, Stack, TreeSet, Iterator, PriorityQueue and Comparable__.

So 12 Test in all, make sure you use the methods that most commonly describe why the data structure exists; e.g. for Stack be sure to use `pop, push, peek and isEmpty`.

#### Note: this is really only a series of tests that you are writing. All your code should go only in the Test portion of the project.

#### Note: import what you need to test all the classes mentions.

##### You may want/need a collection of code you've written that reminds you how to use a particular class.
